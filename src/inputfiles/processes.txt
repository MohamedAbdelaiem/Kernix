# Complex process simulation test case
# Format: ID	arrival	runtime	priority
#id	arrival	runtime	priority
1	0	20	3	# Long-running process starting at time 0
2	28	4	1	# Highest priority process that arrives at the same time
3	28	5	5	# Lowest priority process that arrives at the same time
4	30	2	2	# Short burst process with medium priority
5	32	10	2	# Medium priority, longer runtime
6	32	3	1	# Same arrival time as process 5, higher priority
7	34	1	4	# Very short runtime, low priority
8	35	15	1	# High priority, long runtime
9	35	15	1	# Identical to process 8 (same arrival, runtime, priority)
10	40	4	3	# Arrives during other processes execution
11	43	3	2	# Several processes arriving at once
12	43	8	2	# Same priority as process 11, longer runtime
13	43	2	1	# Highest priority among processes arriving at time 15
14	46	0	3	# Edge case: zero runtime
15	48	30	5	# Very long runtime, lowest priority
16	53	2	1	# Arrives late, high priority
17	53	2	1	# Same as 16, tests handling of same-priority processes
